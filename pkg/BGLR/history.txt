version 1.0 (2012-10-01)
  
  It starts as a copy of BLR version 1.3
  
  major changes, new list interface, models added for continuous, discrete and 
  censored traits. 
  
  For continuous traits:
  
  -Bayes A
  -Bayes B
  -Bayes C-pi
  -RKHS (reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces)
  
  For discrete traits
  
  -Binary responses
  -Ordinal responses
  
  This version will be incompatible with the previous releases, 
  because it was necessary to make major changes to the computing routines.
  
  This version will allow to use the hardware more efficiently. In UNIX-like 
  operating systems it uses OpenMP (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP, http://wwww.openmp.org)
  to perform the computations.
