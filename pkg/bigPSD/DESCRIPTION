Description: An R add-on package capable of computing genomic relationship matrixes and genomic distances.
        This version uses a subset of functions originally found in the package RScaLAPACK (0.6.1),
        which uses the high-performance ScaLAPACK library for the linear algebra computations. The 
        RScaLAPACK package was written by Nagiza F. Samatova <samatovan@ornl.gov>, Srikanth Yoginath
        <yoginathsb@ornl.gov>, David Bauer <bauerda@ornl.gov> and
        Guruprasad Kora <koragh@ornl.gov>
